## Learning :-

We all became proficient in reading the code of team members.

Our code writing style became cleaner as we had to think while writing code that other team members will be reading.

We had to learn about many CSS properties that we didn't know before.

Our skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation became better.

We all learned how to plan a project and execute that.
